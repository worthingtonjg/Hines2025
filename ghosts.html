        <h1>Ghost Encounter Instructions</h1>

        <h2>Lord and Lady Peacock</h2>
        <p>When you see a ghost, snap to attention immediately! Lord Peacock, you must take command with a crisp salute and demand a full debriefing about the ghost’s demise. Address them as “General” or “Colonel” and ask them pointed, military-style questions about their situation. Lady Peacock, your role is to take meticulous imaginary notes and nod solemnly as if their answers are critical intelligence. Keep the performance going until the ghost departs.</p>

        <h2>Mr. and Mrs. Green</h2>
        <p>When a ghost appears, you two must jump into negotiation mode. Mr. Green, offer the ghosts ridiculous business deals—sell them imaginary stocks or try to close on a “lucrative” investment opportunity. Mrs. Green, back him up with assurances of great returns, waving invisible contracts around for the ghost to sign. Keep debating the logistics of ghostly economics until the spirit leaves the room.</p>

        <h2>Miss and Mr. Scarlet</h2>
        <p>When you encounter a ghost, it’s showtime! Miss Scarlet, you must dramatically deliver tragic monologues or heartfelt poetry about the ghosts’ “tragic love story.” Mr. Scarlet, you’ll need to match her energy, declaring your sorrow or theorizing about the betrayal and doom they’ve suffered. Keep your performance as over-the-top as possible until the ghost is gone.</p>

        <h2>Madam and Missy Mustard</h2>
        <p>When a ghost enters, it’s time for a photo shoot! Madam Mustard, start critiquing the lighting and composition, while Missy Mustard demands the ghost “strike a pose” for your imaginary camera. Keep staging your selfies, debating filters, and adjusting your “shot” until the ghost floats away. Don’t forget to argue over who gets the best angle!</p>

        <h2>Mrs. and Dr. White</h2>
        <p>When you see a ghost, switch into full medical mode. Dr. White, you must immediately diagnose the ghost’s “condition,” checking their nonexistent pulse and prescribing hilarious remedies like “extra ectoplasm.” Mrs. White, make sure to scold the ghost for their poor health choices while dusting them with an imaginary feather duster. Keep the examination going until the ghost leaves.</p>

        <h2>Professor and Lady Plum</h2>
        <p>When a ghost appears, it’s time for an impromptu lecture. Professor Plum, dive into an elaborate explanation of “ghostology,” scribbling imaginary equations in the air and theorizing about ectoplasmic physics. Lady Plum, add historical context and discuss the ghosts’ “place in history” as if you’re writing a dissertation. Don’t stop your scholarly banter until the ghost exits.</p>

        <h2>Inspector and Madam Noir</h2>
        <p>When you see a ghost, treat it as your prime suspect! Inspector Noir, interrogate the ghost with rapid-fire questions, demanding an alibi and waving around an invisible magnifying glass. Madam Noir, accuse the ghost of absurd crimes and dramatically declare you’ve uncovered “the truth.” Keep the interrogation going, slamming invisible evidence on tables, until the ghost leaves the room.</p>

        <h2>Mr. and Madam Mahogany</h2>
        <p>When a ghost enters, treat it like a rare artifact! Mr. Mahogany, begin appraising the ghost’s “value,” pointing out unique features and discussing how much they’d fetch at auction. Madam Mahogany, assist by trying to “sell” the ghost to others in the room, hyping their rarity and importance. Keep your antiques show alive until the ghost disappears.</p>

        <h2>Dr. and Professor Orchid</h2>
        <p>When you see a ghost, treat it like a groundbreaking discovery! Dr. Orchid, attempt to “capture” the ghosts in invisible containers, frantically muttering about fixing your mistake. Professor Orchid, make notes about their chemical or botanical traits, as if they’re part of your next research paper. Keep your scientific investigation going until the ghosts leave.</p>

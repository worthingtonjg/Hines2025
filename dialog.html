            <p class="character-name">Miss Scarlet:</p>
            <p>It’s heartbreaking what happened to the Hines couple. But Mrs. Green’s habit of sneaking around has always made me suspicious. I hope justice is served, but I had nothing to do with it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Mr. Scarlet:</p>
            <p>The loss of the Hines couple is truly devastating. That said, Madam Mustard’s long history of making enemies on her travels cannot be ignored. Me? I just write stories, not tragedies like this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Mrs. Green:</p>
            <p>The Hines couple didn’t deserve this—such a terrible loss. But let’s not forget Miss Scarlet’s notorious temper and her past confrontations with them. I’m as shaken as anyone, but I’m no suspect.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Mr. Green:</p>
            <p>How tragic for the Hines couple to meet such an untimely end. Still, Lord Peacock’s secretive past makes me uneasy. If anyone had the skill to orchestrate something like this, it’s him. But I’m not involved—I could never harm anyone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Lord Peacock:</p>
            <p>The deaths of the Hines couple are nothing short of a tragedy. But Dr. Orchid’s research into poisons feels far too convenient in this situation. Me? I’ve left my military days behind—I have nothing to hide.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Lady Peacock:</p>
            <p>It’s such a terrible loss for the community. The Hines couple deserved a brighter future. But Madam Mahogany’s dealings have always raised eyebrows. If anyone knew too much about her business, it was them. I’m grieving like the rest of you.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Professor Plum:</p>
            <p>The Hines couple’s deaths are deeply upsetting. I can’t help but think about Mrs. White’s temper—it’s no secret she had issues with them. But I would never hurt anyone. This situation is horrifying.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Lady Plum:</p>
            <p>I can’t stop thinking about the tragedy of the Hines couple. They had so much ahead of them. But Professor Orchid’s work with toxins makes her a questionable figure in all this. I study history, not harm.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Dr. Orchid:</p>
            <p>The Hines couple’s deaths weigh heavily on all of us. But Professor Plum’s experiments have caused accidents before—who’s to say this wasn’t another one? My work is always controlled and ethical.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Professor Orchid:</p>
            <p>What happened to the Hines couple is beyond tragic. Mr. Scarlet’s eerie ability to write murder plots that feel so real is troubling. I only study plants—I could never be part of something like this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Madam Mustard:</p>
            <p>The Hines couple’s deaths are heartbreaking—I can’t imagine the pain their loved ones are feeling. But Miss Scarlet’s dramatic outbursts have always seemed suspicious. I’d never hurt anyone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Missy Mustard:</p>
            <p>The loss of the Hines couple is such a tragedy. But Mrs. Green’s sneaky behavior lately feels off to me. I’d never want to cause harm—I’m just as shaken as anyone else.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Mrs. White:</p>
            <p>What happened to the Hines couple is truly devastating. Lady Plum’s fascination with poisons feels a little too relevant here, though. I’ve had disagreements in the past, but I’d never stoop to this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Dr. White:</p>
            <p>The tragic end of the Hines couple is something I can’t stop thinking about. Mr. Green’s questionable business dealings make me wonder if they knew something they shouldn’t have. I’ve made mistakes, but nothing like this.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Madam Mahogany:</p>
            <p>The Hines couple’s deaths are a loss for us all. But Lady Peacock’s penchant for collecting secrets might have led to something terrible. I have nothing to hide—I’m just here to mourn and seek the truth.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Mr. Mahogany:</p>
            <p>The passing of the Hines couple is deeply tragic. Lord Peacock’s mysterious history leaves a lot of unanswered questions, though. I could never harm anyone—I just deal in rare items.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Inspector Noir:</p>
            <p>The untimely deaths of the Hines couple are a blow to the entire community. Madam Noir’s past investigations have uncovered dangerous truths before—did they uncover something too close to home? I’m here to find justice, not hide secrets.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="character">
            <p class="character-name">Madam Noir:</p>
            <p>The Hines couple’s story ended far too soon, and it’s unbearable to think about. But Inspector Noir’s eagerness to gather us all raises questions. I expose the truth—I don’t create tragedy.</p>

            <p class="entry-date">October 17, 2005</p>
            <p class="entry-details">"I couldn’t sleep that night—the scent of lavender filled the air so strongly I thought someone had spilled perfume. Around midnight, I saw a faint light flickering near the wardrobe. It seemed to move as if carried by an unseen hand. I swear I heard a woman’s voice, soft and melodic, humming an old tune. The next morning, the scent was gone, but my scarf, which I’d left on the nightstand, was draped neatly across the chair. It’s as though she was still tending to the room."</p>

        <div class="entry">
            <p class="entry-date">June 11, 2011</p>
            <p class="entry-details">"As soon as I entered, I felt an inexplicable sadness. That night, I was startled awake by the sensation of someone gently brushing my hair. I turned on the light, but there was no one there. The room smelled faintly of lavender, and my hairbrush had been moved to the other side of the room."</p>

        <div class="entry">
            <p class="entry-date">February 3, 2014</p>
            <p class="entry-details">"I heard soft footsteps pacing the room around midnight. When I opened my eyes, I thought I saw a shadow near the window, but it faded before I could focus. I also noticed the faint sound of humming—it reminded me of an old lullaby my grandmother used to sing."</p>

        <div class="entry">
            <p class="entry-date">September 20, 2018</p>
            <p class="entry-details">"The lavender scent was overwhelming as I prepared for bed. Later that night, I woke up to see what I thought was a candle burning near the dresser. It vanished when I tried to approach it. In the morning, I found a note on the dresser that simply read, 'Remember.' I have no idea where it came from."</p>

            <p class="entry-date">March 5, 2022</p>
            <p class="entry-details">"This room has a life of its own. I saw what looked like the faint outline of a woman standing by the bed. She didn’t seem threatening, but it was enough to keep me awake the rest of the night. My friend staying in another room said they heard humming coming from this direction."</p>

            <div class="entry">
            <p class="entry-date">July 19, 2024</p>
            <p class="entry-details">"I felt drawn to this room, as though Kitty herself was calling me here. She seemed sad, almost desperate. I found her diary under the bed, with the page marked by a dried lavender flower. Her words hinted that someone close to her had betrayed her—but who? Was it someone she trusted? This makes me think of our situation - I can’t rest knowing there’s a threat among us as well."</p>

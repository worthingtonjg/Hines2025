            <p class="entry-details">"As soon as I walked in, I felt a heaviness in the air. It wasn’t until I tried to sleep that the true strangeness began. The sound of a typewriter—faint but unmistakable—filled the room. At first, I thought someone was playing a prank, but there was no one else staying near me. I also heard what sounded like cards shuffling, but when I got up to check, nothing was there. I left the lights on for the rest of the night."</p>

            <p class="entry-details">"The Lodge felt cozy at first, but by nightfall, it was anything but. I woke up to the sound of footsteps pacing above me, though I was on the top floor. At one point, I thought I heard someone whisper my name, but when I turned on the light, the room was empty."</p>

            <p class="entry-details">"This room has a strange energy. Around 3 AM, the lights flickered, and the sound of shuffling cards seemed to come from the desk. When I checked, nothing was there. I couldn’t shake the feeling that I was being watched."</p>

            <p class="entry-details">"The Lodge’s history fascinated me, but staying here was unsettling. I heard faint laughter echoing in the room, and when I looked in the mirror, I thought I saw a figure behind me. The next morning, my suitcase was on the opposite side of the room from where I’d left it."</p>

            <p class="entry-details">"Nathan always found solace in this room, but I felt its darkness. He thought the history of the lodge was a source of strength, but I fear it held secrets we weren’t meant to uncover. Someone used that history to twist fate against us."</p>

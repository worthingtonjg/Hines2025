            <p class="entry-details">"The room was cold—unbearably cold for June. I thought it was the air conditioning, but when I checked, it was turned off. In the middle of the night, I woke up to find my blankets pulled off the bed. At first, I thought it was my imagination, but then I saw it: a faint shadow on the wall that didn’t match anything in the room. It lingered for a moment before vanishing. I didn’t sleep much after that."</p>

            <p class="entry-details">"I felt uneasy the moment I stepped into the room. Around midnight, I woke up to hear faint whispers, though I couldn’t make out the words. My partner said they felt something cold brush against their arm. The next morning, we found scratches on the wooden bed frame that hadn’t been there before."</p>

I heard what sounded like a woman crying softly. I couldn’t pinpoint the source, but it made the hairs on my neck stand up. I left early the next morning."</p>

The cold seems to echo the chill I felt when I learned of the business deals he was forced into—deals with dangerous men who had too much to lose if the truth came out. Could they have followed us even here?"</p>

            <p class="entry-details">"I had heard about the ghostly gardener, but I never thought I’d experience it myself. Around 2 AM, I heard the faint sound of footsteps on the wooden floor and the rustling of leaves. When I looked into the mirror, I saw what appeared to be a man tending to invisible plants. The most unsettling part was that he seemed so real."</p>

Late at night, I heard whispers and the sound of leaves rustling. When I woke up, I found a single white rose lying on the nightstand. I still can’t explain where it came from."</p>

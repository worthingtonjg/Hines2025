            <p class="entry-details">"This was my first stay at the Hines Mansion, and it will be my last. I could hear the faint crash of waves and the toll of a ship’s bell—it was so vivid, I almost believed the ocean was outside. Around dawn, I felt a presence behind me, as if someone was leaning over the bed. It wasn’t threatening, but it was unnerving. When I got up, I found a single seashell on the windowsill. I’m not sure how it got there—but I didn’t put it there."</p>

            <p class="entry-details">"I stayed here over the holiday, and it was an unforgettable experience. I heard the sound of waves lapping against the shore and what sounded like distant voices calling out. At one point, I thought I felt someone sit at the edge of the bed, but no one was there."</p>

            <p class="entry-details">"The Seaside Retreat felt oddly peaceful during the day, but at night, the sound of a ship’s bell echoed faintly. I dreamed of being on a ship in a storm, and when I woke up, my pillow was damp as if I’d been splashed with water. It’s a memory I’ll never forget."</p>

            <p class="entry-details">"I’d heard about the ghost in this room and didn’t believe it until I experienced it myself. Around midnight, the sound of waves grew louder, and I smelled salt in the air. I also felt a soft breeze, though the windows were shut tight. It was surreal."</p>

            <p class="entry-details">"The waves seem to echo the storm in my mind. Nathan once confided in me about a mysterious letter he received—its warnings were dire, but he dismissed it. Now, I wonder if the sender was closer than we thought, someone who wanted us out of the picture. Why didn’t we see it coming?"</p>
